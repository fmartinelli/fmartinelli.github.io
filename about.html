## About Me

Hi! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Fernán.
Please, feel free to explore.

### Who am I?.

I am a Software Developer looking for new challenges. 
My strong academic background and experience allows me to deliver creative solutions to complex problems. <br>
I enjoy travelling, meeting new people and learning about different cultures.<br>
I'm Argentinian. Born in Córdoba, raised in Rio IV.<br>

### What I do for a living

I'm currently a Technical Leader at Globant.<br>
I'm also doing freelance software development.<br>
I love the art of problem solving. Reason why I am a Software Engineering PhD student at University of Buenos Aires 
where I was also a teaching assistant.<br>
My interests fall in multiple areas, such as different validation and verification tasks when developing/using complex APIs, 
privacy and security, testing and model checking. 
This includes among others analysis and manipulation of programs, using/developing testing tools and using solvers.<br>
I like to participate in all software stages such as design, development and testing the application.<br>
I believe in the power of "standing on the shoulder of giants". Instead of reinventing the wheel I prefer reading, 
learning and taking courses to adapt myself to new technologies. <br>
I enjoy teamwork and can adapt easily.

### What I do for having fun

I really enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, family and friends.<br>
I like travelling.<br>
I love eating a good asado.<br>
Besides my academic background, I also enjoy learning on my own through practice and online resources. <br>
